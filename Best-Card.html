    <p style="color: powderblue;" id="5card">The Blue-Eyes White Dragon is one of the most famous and known cards in all of Yu-Gi-Oh that even people who don't know Yu-Gi-Oh would probably recognize the card. this card is known for being used by Kaiba. It allows you to use some of the best cards of all time and even without that ability, it's still a great card. It alone has <b>3,000 attack </b>and <b>2,500 defense</b>. If you have 3 of them in your deck, you can fuse them to get the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon which has <b>4,500 attack</b>. The best part is that the card is usable in tournaments.<p>

    <p style="color: powderblue;" id="4carD">Dark Magician is one of Yugi's signature cards in the show. Dark Magician was introduced in the first episode of the <b>Yu-Gi-Oh!</b> show. To summon Dark Magician, you need to sacrifice one monster card that is on the playing field. He has <b>2,500 attack </b>and <b>2,100 defense</b>  which is a great deal for sacrificing one momnster card. It's a card that is still allowed to be used in-game. the Dark Magician doesn't have any effect but its a Magician archetype meaning it can be used as a trump set of a deck if used with Spellcaster monster cards. One great example would be if you have the Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl, and one more Spellcaster-type monster card and together, you can fuse them to creare the Dark Magicians which is a fusion card with high attack and defese points.

    <p style="color: powderblue;" id="3caRd">Exodia the Forbidden One is literally one of the <b>Top 3 Cards</b> in all of the game. It isn't one card but instead, a set of cards. It's a set of Dark Spellcaster monster cards. Its one of the most popular cards to date. The Forbidden One cards are referred to as "Exodia" cards but they shouldn't be mixed up with the Exodia archetype which is a seperate but related archetype which only <b>Exodia The Forbidden One</b> is apart of it. It's believed that Exodia is meant to reference the Egyptian legend of Osiris which was an Egyptian God who was betrated by his jealous brother Set and was cut into pieces and spread out through Egypt which explains why Exodia is a set of cards. The Exodia set of cards is made up of 5 cards needed to complete the Forbidden One which are: the head, left arm, right arm, left leg, and the right leg. If you get all 5, you hust automatically win the game.

    <p style="color: powderblue;" id="2cArd">Silfer The Sky Dragon is one of the most powerful spirits in all of <b>Yu-Gi-Oh!</b>. It's one of the 3 Egyptian Gods and is recommended as one of the best of the 3 Egyptian God cards for players with Obelisk the Tormentor and The Winged Dragon of Ra. in the show, these monsters could only be summoned by the person chosen as the Pharaoh. to summon it in the game, you must sacrific 3 "tributes" and it'll gain <b>1,000 attack </b>and <b>1,000 defense</b> for each card in the player's hand and if it's played, each monster that's summoned on the opponent's field will lose <b>2,000 attack</b>. The archetype that Silfer The Sky Dragon belonges to is the Divine Beast Monster cards. due it's broken effect, the card is banned from all game tournaments worldwide.

    <p style="color: powderblue;" id="1Card">Many people will not agree with me, but in my personal opinion, <b>Pot of Greed</b> is the best card in the game. The card is a spell card and when played, its effect is that it allows who played it to draw 2 cards, 2 simple cards. There are no side effects or any <b>once per turn clauses</b> and just lets you draw 2 cards. This may sound simple, but this is way more powerful than it may seem and is the reason that <b>this card is banned from being played in tournamends worldwide</b>. To give an example, I'm going to use this card and a card I mentioned previously, <b>Exodia The Forbidden One</b>. In <b>Yu-Gi-Oh!</b>, your deck needs to have between 40-60 cards and they can be any cards, now imagine in a tournament, the player who goes first, has a deck of 40 cards and 35 of them are pot of greed and the other 5 are <b>Exodia the Forbidden One's</b> pieces. That player could win the game in one turn by just playing <b>Pot of greed</b> and taking 2 cards till he has all the pieces of Exodia The Forbidden One in his hand and winning the game. For this reason, the card is banned and is the best card in the game.
