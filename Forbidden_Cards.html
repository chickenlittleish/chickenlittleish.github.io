    <p style="color:whitesmoke;">Yu-Gi-Oh has many cards that are forbidden from being played. According to <b>Konami</b>, cards which are "forbidden" can't be in your Main, Extra, or Side deck. You can only have a maximum of 1 copy of cards that are "limited" and you can only have a maximum of 2 copies of cards that are "semi-limited". Yu-Gi-Oh has around 100 forbidden cards, around 84 limited cards, and 6 semi limited cards. These are some of my favorite forbidden/banned cards: <p style="color:whitesmoke;">(You can find the full list <a href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/uk/limited/"><b>HERE</b></a> )<p><hr><br><b>
        <p style="color: powderblue;">1) Dijinn Releaser of Rituals

        <div class="ritual">
    <p style="color: powderblue;"><b>Dijinn Releaser of Rituals</b> looks a bit like a weird card but because its on the list of banned cards, that means the card is broken or players found a way to break the card. The description of the card is that if you ritual summon a monster, you can send this card to the graveyard as a replacement of 1 of the monsters needed for the ritual summon. If you ritual summon using this card, the other player can't special summon any monsters while the ritual summoned monster is face-up on the playing field. The reason this is broken is because most speial summmon cards in the game are strong and not being able to play one is a huge huge disatvantage so it makes sense why they would ban this card.</p>

     <p style="color: powderblue;">2) Cyber Jar
    <p></b><img src="file:///Users/saifnimer/Desktop/51uWIH1Z6fL._AC_.jpg"/p><br>
    <p style="color: powderblue;"><b>Cyber Jar</b> is a card that makes me question what the creators where thinking when making it. If you flip Cyber Jar, it allows you to destroy all the monsters on the field belonging to you and your opponent, then, both of you need to reveal the top 5 cards in  their deck, then special summon all lever 4 or lower revealed monsters in a dace-up attack position or face-down defense position, and then, add any remaining cards to their hand. If you have less than 5 cards in your deck, then just reveal as many as possible. The description of the card alone reveals how broken it is and I don't think I need to explain more.
           <p style="color: powderblue;">3) Arachnemeses Protos
    <p></b><img src="file:///Users/saifnimer/Desktop/6728559.jpg"/p><br>
    <p style="color: powderblue;"><b>Archnemeses Protos</b> is a card that seems to be a toned down version of cypber jar. The card's text says that the card must first be special summoned from your hand by sending 3 monsters of 3 different attributes from your graveyard or face-up field. It cannot be destroyed by card effects. The part that is broken is what comes next which is that you can choose 1 monster attribute that is on the playing field and destroy every monster on the field with the same attribute. Another side effect is that until the end of the next turn, no player can special summon monsters with that attribute that you destroyed. You can only use the effects of this card once per turn. there are 2 things which are majorly broken here. 1, is how you can destroy every monster of a specific attribute on the field which is broken because, lets say your opponent had a deck with mainly fairy cards, you could play this card and choose fairy, and you would be able to destroy every card they played which is broken and the cards description lets you do it once every turn which is too broken if you think of it with the same example.
